# CreatorPay

### Introduction

CreatorPay is a streamlined payment system based on Circle programmable wallet. It is designed to facilitate the subscription and purchase of content within digital publishing platforms, offering a seamless transaction experience. CreatorPay aims to support the creative industry by providing a reliable and automated financial framework, thus encouraging the growth and circulation of original content. It's not just a payment system; it's a tool for maintaining the vitality and integrity of digital publishing.

#### Core Features:
- Developer-Controlled Wallets: When a creator publishes content, a dedicated wallet set is assigned to that particular content stream. Subsequently, users who subscribe or make purchases are assigned individual wallets that fall under this creator-specific wallet set, allowing for direct fund management.
- Automatic Payments: With automatic balance checks and payment processing, subscribers enjoy continuous access to exclusive content without manual intervention.
- Unsubscription and Refunds: Users can cancel subscriptions at any time, with the system calculating and refunding any unused amounts back to their wallets.
- Creator Support Feature: A new function allowing users to transfer any amount directly to content creators as a show of support and appreciation for their original work.
